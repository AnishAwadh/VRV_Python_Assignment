# Log Analysis Script  

A powerful Python script to parse and analyze server log files for insights into:  

- **Request Patterns**: Identify the number of requests per IP address.  
- **Top Endpoints**: Find the most frequently accessed resources.  
- **Suspicious Activity**: Detect brute force login attempts and flag suspicious IPs.  

## Key Features  
- **Scalable**: Efficiently handles large log files.  
- **Customizable**: Configurable thresholds for detecting anomalies.  
- **User-Friendly Output**: Results displayed in the terminal and saved in a clean CSV format.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python 3  
- Regular Expressions  
- Collections Module  

## How It Works  
1. Parses log files to extract critical information like IP addresses, endpoints, and status codes.  
2. Performs analysis to detect patterns and potential security threats.  
3. Outputs insights in both the terminal and a CSV file (`log_analysis_results.csv`).  

## Getting Started  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
